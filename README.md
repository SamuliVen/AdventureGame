# GhostHuntGame

A game made during Aalto University's open course of Programming 1 with Scala.
The game is based on course material which was provided but design of the game and most of the aspects were done by me.

There is a walkthrough and a map in the folder for easier testing.

Game works well with IntelliJ that has Scala plugin.
